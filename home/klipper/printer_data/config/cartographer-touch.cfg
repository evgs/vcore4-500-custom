[scanner]
#   Path to the serial port for the Cartographer device. Typically has the form
#   /dev/serial/by-id/usb-cartographer_cartographer_...
#   
#   If you are using the CAN Bus version, replace serial: with canbus_uuid: and add the UUID.
#   Example: canbus_uuid: 1283as878a9sd
#
#serial: /dev/serial/by-id/usb-cartographer_cartographer_...
canbus_uuid: bd2c17e08f53

#   Offsets are measured from the centre of your coil, to the tip of your nozzle 
#   on a level axis. It is vital that this is accurate.

x_offset: 0.0
y_offset: 21.1

#   Backlash compensation distance for removing Z backlash before measuring
#   the sensor response.
backlash_comp: 0.005

calibration_method: touch
#    leave this as touch unless you want to use scan only for everything. 
sensor: cartographer
#    this must be set as cartographer unless using IDM etc.
sensor_alt: carto
#    alternate name to call commands. CARTO_TOUCH etc
#scanner_touch_z_offset: 0.05         
#    This is the default and will be overwritten and added to the DO NOT SAVE area by using UI to save z offset
mesh_runs: 2
#    Number of passes to make during mesh scan.
